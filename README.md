## About HELP ME!!

In 2020, we lost our beloved Selena. She was young, beautiful, and full of life. But one day my son came home to find her lifeless body. He called 911 for help but because he was hysterical, valuable time was wasted as 911 struggled to understand his needs and location. Valuable time was lost --- time that could have saved her life.

I spent many years as a medic before becoming a software engineer and I know the struggle 911 operators face when trying to help a panicked family member. Since that November day when we lost Selena, I knew I wanted to fix this issue. 

👷 👷 👷This is still a work in progress.👷 👷👷 

#### 🚩 THE PROBLEM: 
##### There is often valuable time lost during translation on a 911 call.

#### ✨ THE SOLUTION: 

        👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  1. Create profiles for every household member to answer (ahead of time) all the questions the 911 will ask along with the address

        🚨  2. If there is an emergency, the user will choose the household member in need, along with the location

        🆘  3. This information is sent to the local 911 operator via RapidSOS

        ❓  4. The questions are answered. The 911 operator can go straight to providing instructions while help is on the way

        💙  5. The frantic family member doesn't need to convey any information. They can simply receive the help they need

### TECH STACK

📌 Though I have built a backend for this project, it will ultimately be replaced by the backend RapidSOS will create for this app.
